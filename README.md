Customer Churn Prediction Project

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to predict customer churn for a telecommunications company. By identifying customers who are likely to leave, the company can take proactive measures to retain them. This report details the steps taken to understand the data, build and evaluate predictive models, and provide actionable recommendations.

 Business Understanding
Objective: Predict customer churn to improve customer retention strategies.

Stakeholders: Marketing team, Customer retention department, Senior management.

Impact: Reducing the churn rate can significantly increase revenue by retaining existing customers, which is more cost-effective than acquiring new ones.

 Data Understanding and Preparation
 Dataset Description
The dataset contains information about the customers of a telecommunications company, including their account details, usage patterns, service subscriptions, and whether they have churned.

 Key Features
- state: The state code where the customer resides.
- account length: The number of days the account has been active.
- area code: The area code of the customer’s phone number.
- phone number: The customer’s phone number.
- international plan: Whether the customer has an international plan.
- voice mail plan: Whether the customer has a voice mail plan.
- number vmail messages: Number of voice mail messages.
- total day minutes, total day calls, total day charge: Usage metrics during the day.
- total eve minutes, total eve calls, total eve charge: Usage metrics during the evening.
- total night minutes, total night calls, total night charge: Usage metrics during the night.
- total intl minutes, total intl calls, total intl charge: International usage metrics.
- customer service calls: Number of calls to customer service.
- churn: Whether the customer has churned or not (target variable).

 Data Loading and Overview
python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import numpy as np

 Load the dataset
df = pd.read_csv("/content/Customer-Churn.csv")

 Display the first few rows of the dataframe
df.head()

 Display summary statistics of the dataframe
df.describe()

 Display information about the dataframe
df.info()

 Check for missing values
print(df.isnull().sum())

Output indicates there are no missing values.

 Data Exploration
Further data exploration steps involve visualizing the distribution of key features and relationships between them to understand the data better.

 Model Building and Evaluation
 Model Selection
Several machine learning models will be considered, including logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting machines. 

 Evaluation Metrics
Model performance will be evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC score.

 Actionable Insights and Recommendations
Based on the model's predictions, actionable insights and recommendations will be provided to help the telecommunications company reduce churn and retain customers.
